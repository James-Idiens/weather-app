## About this project

This is a classic and very simple weather app where a user can search a location and the current weather is displayed. The purpose of building this project was to produce a small, complete application that intergrates the tech I have been learning. It uses React on the front end, and superfetch to gather data from an external API. This also served as an introduction to tailwind for me.

# React with Express and Vite

This is a starter project that uses Vite to bundle a React app and Express to serve it in production. Express is used in development to serve an API server.

Vite React App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Express API Server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Requests to `http://localhost:5173/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Setup

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`.
